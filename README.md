# Un-named Winter Survival Game

## Game things
Inventory must be child of Player not child of game
Mouse needs to have a modified slot, stripped down version of the Slot class that allows the slots and the mouse to communicate with each other.

## Concept
Player spawns with few simple hand tools in a canadian wilderness. There are a few days until the first snowstorm of the season and the goal is to survive.

Rogue-like upgrade/equipment system?

Starting tools?
    simple knife - not great for anything, but does a little bit of everything
    small axe - can cut down smaller trees and prepare firewood

Basic game loop
    Spawn > Collect resources > Build shelter > Survive winter [impossible]

Inventory system
    Sheath - holds knife
    2 Belthooks - holds (axe / saw / folding shovel / etc)
    Belt pouch - holds small items (kindling / stones / etc)
    Hands - Can carry larger items, mostly single items
