# Un-named Winter Survival Game

## Game things
Inventory must be child of Player not child of game
Mouse needs to have a modified slot, stripped down version of the Slot class that allows the slots and the mouse to communicate with each other.

We need inventory access in the main menu. There needs to be a "stockpile" system (maybe like EFT but persistent)

## Concept
Player spawns with few simple hand tools in a canadian wilderness. There are a few days until the first snowstorm of the season and the goal is to survive.

Rogue-like upgrade/equipment system?

Starting tools?
    simple knife - not great for anything, but does a little bit of everything
    small axe - can cut down smaller trees and prepare firewood

Basic game loop
    Spawn > Collect resources > Build shelter > Survive winter [impossible] __unless__ the player figures out whats causing the endless winter? PVE until final "boss fight"

Inventory system
    Sheath - holds knife
    2 Belthooks - holds (axe / saw / folding shovel / etc)
    Belt pouch - holds small items (kindling / stones / etc)
    Hands - Can carry larger items, mostly single items
    
## Game Story
Something is causing the endless winter? Or maybe something is causing the player to be in an endless cycle (groundhog day style loop)

## Upgrade an point system
Player gets points for the amount of days that they successfully survive. 1 point per day or more?

Upgrades are permanent, but the player is only able to take a certian amount of items into a run with them.
